# WordPress-Base-Theme
A WordPress starter theme based off of Underscores.me.  

I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

This theme, like Underscores, uses minimal CSS so there is less stuff to get in your way.

Base Theme includes additional customizer functionality for html elements including:
* Links
* Buttons
* Base Font Size
* Font Color

Additional functionality on top of the Underscores Theme:
* Page template for one column content without a sidebar.
* Page template to dusplay sidebar on the left.
* Option to add a logo in Customizer.
* Bootstrap 12 column grid system included.

Getting Started
---------------
Get started by replacing the 'basetheme' name in all of the files.  This can be done by doing a 'Find and Replace All' in any text editor.

* Search for: `'basetheme'` and replace with: `'yourtheme'`
* Search for: `base_theme` and replace with: `your_theme`
* Search for: `Text Domain: base theme` and replace with: `Text Domain: your theme` in style.css.
* Search for: <code>&nbsp;_s</code> and replace with: <code>&nbsp;Megatherium</code>

Then, update the stylesheet header in `style.css` and the links in `footer.php` with your own information. Next, update or delete this readme.

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
